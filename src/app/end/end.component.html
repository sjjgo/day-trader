      This experiment compared the efficacy of different commercial multiplayer
      games in trust development in virtual teams. Trust is a multi-facet
      construct which is thought to develop via interpersonal information
      exchange, risk and interdependence. As such, trust was measured via an
      intra-team trust survey and a prisonerâ€™s dilemma-type game called Day
      Trader. We hope you have enjoyed this experiment. If you have any
      questions, please email [researcher name] ([researcher email address]).

    In this next part of the experiment you are a day-trader for the next 5
    days. One round represents 1 day. Each round, you will receive $40 and have
    to decide whether to invest as an individual or risk investing with the
    group.
  </p>
  <p>
    The individual investment yields a guaranteed doubling of the payoff every
    round. On the other hand, the group investment payoff is dependent on how
    much other traders have invested in the common pool such that every playersâ€™
    contributions are lumped together, multiplied by 4, and then distributed
    back evenly. The person with the highest individual payoff at the end wins!
